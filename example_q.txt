Given monthly demands of 100, 150, 80, 130 units and a setup cost of $1000, unit cost $50, and holding cost $2 per unit per month, what is the optimal production plan and total cost?

We have monthly demands of 120, 80, 200, 90 units.
The production capacity each month is limited to 150 units.
Setup cost $900, unit production cost $47, and holding cost $3 per unit per month.
What is the optimal production plan, ending inventory each month, and total cost?

“Over the next 12 months we expect demands of
95, 120, 80, 140, 60, 110, 130, 70, 90, 150, 85, 100 units respectively.
The fixed setup cost each time we start production is $1 200,
unit production cost is $55, and inventory holding cost is $2.50 per unit per month.
Assuming we start with zero inventory, what is the optimal production schedule, month-ending inventory, and total cost?”

“Our plant faces monthly capacity limits.
Demands for the next ten months are
180, 140, 220, 160, 130, 250, 170, 190, 210, 150 units.
Maximum we can produce each month is
200, 180, 200, 190, 170, 260, 190, 200, 220, 180 units.
Setup cost is $900 whenever we run the line,
variable unit cost $48, and holding cost $3 per unit per month.
We have 20 units of opening inventory.
Please give the optimal production plan, month-by-month ending inventory, setup decisions, and total cost under these capacity constraints.
